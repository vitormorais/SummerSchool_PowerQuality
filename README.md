Systec Summer School: Module 3 -- Power Quality 
----

This repository comprises two important folders: **\1. scripts** and **\2. data** to support the module

### Current Development Version
There are two options:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Download a ZIP file of the repository from GitHub.


### System Requirements
*   MATLAB version 9.4 (R2021a) or later
*   (older versions might not be compatible)

### Usage
1. Open the matlab with the workspace in the cloned repository;
2. Run the file **a.load_data.mlx**
3. Run the script **b.process_voltage_grid.mlx** to analyse the grid voltage (DEMO1);
4. Run the script **c.process_current_1ph.mlx** to analyse the grid currents (DEMO2);
5. Run the script **d.process_power_3p.mlx** to analyse the generated 3p system (DEMO3);

## !!!!  CHALLENGE  !!!!

#### Grid voltage analysis
*  get RMS value and check if complies w/ standards
*  get THD value and check if complies w/ standards
*  perform spectrum analysis
*  
#### Grid current analysis
*  perform a comparison analysis between different loads;

#### Three-phase analysis
* get the impedance value of the load.
