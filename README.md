Systec Summer School: Module Power Quality 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository comprises two important folders: **\1. scripts** and **\2. data** to support the module

### Current Development Version
There are two options:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Download a ZIP file of the repository from GitHub.


### System Requirements
*   MATLAB version 9.4 (R2021a) or later
*   (older versions might not be compatible)

------------
### Installation
1. The installation only requires download of the repository.


### Usage
1. Open the matlab with the workspace in the cloned repository;
2. Run the file **a.load_data.mlx**
3. Run the script **b.process_voltage_grid.mlx** to analyse the grid voltage (DEMO1);
4. Run the script **c.process_current_1ph.mlx** to analyse the grid currents (DEMO2);
5. Run the script **d.process_power_3p.mlx** to analyse the generated 3p system (DEMO3);

### !!!!  CHALLENGE  !!!!
##### Grid voltage analysis
1. get RMS value and check if complies w/ standards
2. get THD value and check if complies w/ standards
3. perform spectrum analysis
##### Grid current analysis
1. perform a comparison analysis between different loads;

##### Three-phase analysis
1. get the impedance value of the load.
